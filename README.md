# Countries project

This project makes use from two API's, one's from https://api.openweathermap.org
and the other noes is from https://restcountries.com.

Here we try to accomplish a simple fetching from both api's
and use their responses to display it on the web.

### What did I use 
- nodejs
- npm
- React
- Axios 

___
#### To consider: 
As you may know, openweathermap needs a token to fetch
data. If this token expires, then we won't be able to display
the correct information as we wanted.
